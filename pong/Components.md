For taking this project there are some posible variations, but for sure you will need the following:
    -An arduino microcontroller, in my case I will be using an Arduino UNO
    -Any graphical compatible screen (OLED, TFT, etc), I have a tiny 0.96" SSD1306
    -Something to control the player, I am using a PS2 joystick module for arduino, but if you want you could control it with a pair
    of buttons per player
    -Some wires and a breadboard
