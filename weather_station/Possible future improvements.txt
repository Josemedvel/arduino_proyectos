**Possible Improvements for future versions**
Adding of a RTC module, whether DS3231 or DS1307 for the displaying of the date and hour.
Adding of a Gas sensor, to know the level of CO2, CO, or even ammonium (NH3).
Adding of a IOT module to connect to a website where we could see the temperature, air pressure, and humidity online.
