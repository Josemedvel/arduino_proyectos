To carry out this proyect you will need the following:
	1x Humidity and temperature sensor DHT11 (in this case I will be only using it's humidity sensor)
	1x Temperature and pressure sensor BMP280
	1x Arduino board (it does not matter, but the pinout might change if not an UNO as mine)
Optional equipment:
	1x LCD display with I2C module to only use 2 pins
	1x Level shifter (to use serial data and serial clock for the display and the BMP280, that have different operating voltages)
